[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> **Exercise:** The numbers generated by `numpy.random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

>> Generate 1000 numbers from `numpy.random.random` and plot their PMF.  What goes wrong?

>> Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

In this excercise we have been asked to generate 1000 random numbers using `numpy.random.random`. This generates a set of 1000 random numbers all between 0 and 1. 

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sample = np.random.random(1000)
sample[1:30]
```

This generates an array of 1000 random number. A slice of 30 numbers of this array is given below:

```
array([0.13990092, 0.74803318, 0.76784486, 0.82622793, 0.73298891,
       0.39270526, 0.25854819, 0.76039782, 0.01381283, 0.65655262,
       0.82711272, 0.08302303, 0.60354681, 0.892133  , 0.28160196,
       0.1465366 , 0.36699931, 0.66590795, 0.05132025, 0.14578164,
       0.39295632, 0.28260693, 0.01178234, 0.24109259, 0.45656274,
       0.16357348, 0.07562465, 0.76499067, 0.41359306])
```
The frequency distribution for these numbers is generated below:
```
sample_hist=plt.hist(samples)
plt.savefig('random_sample_hist.png')
```

Since these numbers are generated randomly, the probability of each of these numbers is uniform, i.e, the probability of generating each number is 0.001 or 1 in 1000. If we calculate the PMF of this distribution - which, by the way is not uniform - and plotting it using the code below:

```
sample_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(sample, label='sample')
thinkplot.Pmf(sample_pmf, linewidth =0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel=' random sample', ylabel='Pmf')
plt.savefig('random_sample_pmf.png')
```
We get the following plot:

![Sample_PMF](https://github.com/swv293/ThinkStats2/blob/master/code/random_sample_pmf.png)

Based on this graph we can see that although the probability is the same for all the values generated, the distribution in itself is not uniform.

Now, if we plot the CDF of the same distribution using the code below:

```
sample_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample, label='sample')
thinkplot.Cdf(sample_cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='random sample', ylabel='CDF', loc='upper left')
plt.savefig('random_sample_cdf.png')

```

We get the following plot:

![Sample_CDF](https://github.com/swv293/ThinkStats2/blob/master/code/random_sample_cdf.png)

Overall, the CDF is almost a straight line suggesting that the distribution is truly random with all the values having the same probability, it is not a perfect straight line as the 1000 random values are sparse over some regions while closer in other regions (compare the histogram and the PMF above), a fact that is reflected in the CDF as well.
